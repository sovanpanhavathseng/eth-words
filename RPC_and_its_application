RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call. It is a communication protocol that allows a program on one computer to call a procedure or function on another computer without having to understand the underlying network details.

Here's a concise explanation of RPC and its application:

RPC: Remote Procedure Call is a protocol that enables a program to request a service or invoke a function on a remote system over a network. It abstracts the communication complexity and provides a simple interface for inter-process communication.

Application: RPC has various applications in distributed systems and client-server architectures:

Client-server communication: RPC is commonly used for communication between client applications and server applications. Clients can make requests to servers by invoking remote procedures or functions, and the server processes those requests and returns the results to the client.

Distributed systems: RPC facilitates communication between different components or modules of a distributed system. It allows different nodes or services to invoke functions or exchange data across the network, enabling coordination and collaboration among distributed components.

Microservices architecture: In a microservices architecture, RPC is used to enable communication between different microservices. Services can make RPC calls to request data or trigger actions in other services, allowing them to interact and cooperate to fulfill complex business processes.

API communication: Many APIs use RPC protocols to provide client applications with access to their services. Clients send RPC requests to the API, which processes those requests and returns the requested data or performs the specified actions.

Cross-platform communication: RPC enables communication between systems or applications developed on different platforms or using different programming languages. It abstracts the communication details, allowing heterogeneous systems to interact seamlessly.

Remote procedure invocation: RPC can be used for remote procedure invocation within a single application or system. It allows different components or modules of an application to communicate and execute functions across different processes or machines.

Overall, RPC is a widely used communication protocol for enabling inter-process communication and interaction between distributed components in various architectures, including client-server systems, microservices, and distributed systems.
