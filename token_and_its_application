A token is a digital representation of an asset or utility on a blockchain. It can have various applications depending on the specific blockchain platform and its intended use. Here are some common applications of tokens:

Cryptocurrencies: Tokens can function as digital currencies, serving as a medium of exchange within a specific blockchain ecosystem. Examples include Bitcoin (BTC) on the Bitcoin blockchain and Ether (ETH) on the Ethereum blockchain.

Utility Tokens: Tokens can be used to access and utilize specific services or applications within a blockchain platform. These utility tokens enable users to pay for goods, services, or access certain functionalities. For instance, Filecoin (FIL) tokens provide storage space on the Filecoin network.

Security Tokens: Tokens can represent ownership or fractional ownership of a real-world asset, such as equity in a company, real estate, or commodities. Security tokens aim to comply with regulatory requirements and provide investors with the benefits of traditional securities in a tokenized form.

Governance Tokens: Tokens can grant holders voting rights and decision-making power within a decentralized network or platform. Holders can participate in shaping the platform's future by voting on proposals, protocol upgrades, or other governance matters. Examples include MakerDAO's MKR token and Compound's COMP token.

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): NFTs are unique tokens that represent ownership of a specific item, such as digital art, collectibles, or virtual real estate. NFTs have gained popularity in the art and gaming sectors, allowing for the creation, ownership, and trading of unique digital assets.

Tokenized Assets: Tokens can represent ownership or rights to physical assets, such as real estate, precious metals, or artwork. Tokenization enables fractional ownership, liquidity, and efficient transfer of traditionally illiquid assets.

These are just a few examples of how tokens can be applied within blockchain ecosystems. The specific use cases and applications of tokens can vary depending on the platform, its purpose, and the needs of its users.
