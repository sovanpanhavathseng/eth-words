A transaction fee is a small amount of cryptocurrency that users pay to include their transactions in a blockchain network. Here are the applications and purposes of transaction fees:

Incentivizing Miners/Validators: Transaction fees serve as an incentive for miners or validators in blockchain networks that use a Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Miners/validators are rewarded with transaction fees in addition to block rewards for adding transactions to the blockchain. The fees motivate them to validate transactions and secure the network.

Prioritizing Transactions: Transaction fees help prioritize the processing of transactions within a blockchain network. Miners/validators usually prioritize transactions with higher fees because including those transactions in the blockchain will result in a higher reward for them. This mechanism encourages users to attach appropriate fees to ensure their transactions are processed in a timely manner.

Preventing Spam and Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks: Transaction fees act as a deterrent against spam and DoS attacks. By requiring a fee for each transaction, it becomes economically unfeasible for malicious actors to flood the network with a large number of low-value or frivolous transactions, which could clog the network and disrupt its operation.

Network Resource Allocation: Transaction fees help allocate network resources efficiently. When the network becomes congested, higher transaction fees incentivize users to compete for limited block space, resulting in a more efficient allocation of resources and a smoother operation of the blockchain.

Sustainability of the Network: Transaction fees contribute to the sustainability of blockchain networks. In networks without inflationary block rewards or as block rewards decrease over time, transaction fees become a crucial source of income for miners/validators, ensuring the continued operation and security of the network.

It's important to note that the specific mechanism and calculation of transaction fees can vary among different blockchain platforms. Users need to consider factors like network congestion, transaction size, and the desired transaction speed when determining an appropriate fee to include with their transactions.
