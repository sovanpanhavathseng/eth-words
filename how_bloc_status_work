Block status is a feature on social media platforms that allows users to prevent certain individuals from seeing their posts. This can be useful for users who want to avoid unwanted contact or harassment.

To block someone on a social media platform, users typically need to go to the person's profile and click on a "block" button. Once someone has been blocked, they will no longer be able to see the user's posts, and the user will no longer be able to see the blocked person's posts.

Block status can be a helpful way to protect users from unwanted contact. However, it is important to note that blocking someone does not prevent them from seeing your profile or sending you messages.
