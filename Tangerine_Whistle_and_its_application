I apologize, but I still don't have any information regarding "Tangerine Whistle" in the context of Ethereum (ETH) or any specific application related to it. It's possible that the term is not widely used or recognized within the Ethereum community. If you have any other questions or if there's something else I can assist you with, please let me know.
