A message call is a type of communication that allows two or more people to have a conversation in real time. Message calls can be made using a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers.

To make a message call, you first need to create a message account. Once you have created an account, you can add friends or family members to your contact list. To start a message call, simply select the person you want to call and tap the call button.

Message calls work by using the internet to transmit voice and video data. This means that you do not need to be connected to a cellular network to make a message call. Message calls can be made over Wi-Fi or cellular data.

Message calls are a convenient and affordable way to stay in touch with friends and family. They are also a great way to make business calls, as they allow you to have a face-to-face conversation with someone without having to travel.

Here are some of the benefits of using message calls:

* **Convenient:** Message calls can be made from any device with an internet connection. This means that you can make a call from anywhere, at any time.
* **Affordable:** Message calls are often free or very low-cost. This makes them a great option for budget-minded users.
* **Secure:** Message calls are often encrypted, which means that your conversations are private.
* **Reliable:** Message calls are usually reliable, even if you have a poor internet connection.

Here are some of the drawbacks of using message calls:

* **Quality:** The quality of message calls can vary depending on the internet connection. If you have a poor internet connection, the call may be choppy or have a lot of static.
* **Battery drain:** Message calls can drain your battery quickly. If you are planning on making a long call, it is a good idea to bring a charger with you.
* **Data usage:** Message calls can use a lot of data. If you are on a limited data plan, you may want to avoid making message calls.

Overall, message calls are a convenient and affordable way to stay in touch with friends and family. They are also a great way to make business calls, as they allow you to have a face-to-face conversation with someone without having to travel.
