Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. It is used to pay for gas, which is the computational power required to execute transactions and smart contracts on the Ethereum network.

Ether is also used to secure the Ethereum network through a process called proof-of-work (PoW). In PoW, miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems in order to add new blocks to the blockchain. The first miner to solve a problem is rewarded with Ether.

Ether is a decentralized cryptocurrency, which means that it is not subject to government or financial institution control. It is also a scarce resource, with a limited supply of 100 million ETH. This makes Ether a valuable asset that can be used to store value, make payments, and participate in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Here are some of the key features of Ether:
