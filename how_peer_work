Peer work is a form of support provided by people who have had their own experience with a particular challenge, such as mental health, addiction, or homelessness. Peer workers use their own experiences to help others understand that they are not alone and that recovery is possible. They can also provide practical support, such as help with finding housing or employment.

Peer work can be done in a variety of settings, such as hospitals, schools, community centers, and prisons. Peer workers may work one-on-one with clients, in groups, or in the community.

There are many benefits to peer work. Peer workers can provide a sense of hope and understanding that can be difficult to find from professionals. They can also offer practical support and advice that is tailored to the individual's needs. In addition, peer work can help to reduce stigma and isolation, and it can promote social inclusion.
