Oracle is a relational database management system (RDBMS). RDBMSs are software that store and manage data in a structured way. Oracle is one of the most popular RDBMSs in the world, and it is used by businesses of all sizes.

Oracle works by storing data in tables. Tables are made up of rows and columns. Rows represent individual records, and columns represent the different pieces of data that make up each record. For example, a table of customer records might have columns for the customer's name, address, and phone number.
