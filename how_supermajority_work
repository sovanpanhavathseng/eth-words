A supermajority is a requirement for a proposal to gain a specified level of support which is greater than the threshold of more than one-half used for a simple majority. The exact percentage required for a supermajority varies depending on the context.

For example, in the United States, a supermajority is required to override a presidential veto. In this case, the supermajority is two-thirds of both houses of Congress. This means that 67 of the 100 Senators and 290 of the 435 Representatives must vote in favor of overriding the veto in order for it to be successful.

Supermajorities are often used in situations where it is important to ensure that there is broad support for a particular action. This is because a supermajority requires a large number of people to agree, which can make it more difficult for a small group of people to exert undue influence.

There are a number of reasons why a supermajority might be required. In some cases, it may be necessary to ensure that there is a high level of public support for a particular action. This is often the case with constitutional amendments, which require a supermajority in order to be ratified. In other cases, a supermajority may be used to protect the rights of a minority group. For example, in the United States, a supermajority is required to change the voting rights of citizens.

Supermajorities can also be used to prevent hasty or ill-considered decisions. By requiring a large number of people to agree, supermajorities can help to ensure that a proposal has been carefully considered and that there is a strong consensus in favor of it.

However, supermajorities can also have some drawbacks. One drawback is that they can make it more difficult to pass legislation or take other action. This is because a supermajority requires a large number of people to agree, which can be difficult to achieve. Another drawback is that supermajorities can give a disproportionate amount of power to a small number of people. This is because a small number of people can block a proposal even if it has the support of a majority of people.

Overall, supermajorities are a tool that can be used to achieve a number of goals. However, it is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of supermajorities before using them.
