Đ (D with stroke) is a letter of the Vietnamese alphabet. It is pronounced as a voiced alveolar implosive (/ɗ/) or, according to Thompson (1959), a preglottalized voiced alveolar stop (/ʔd/). Whereas D is pronounced as some sort of dental or alveolar stop in most Latin alphabets, an unadorned D in Vietnamese represents either /z/ (Hanoian) or /j/ (Saigonese).

Đ is the seventh letter of the Vietnamese alphabet, after D and before E. Traditionally, digraphs and trigraphs like CH and NGH were considered letters as well, making Đ the eighth letter. Đ is a letter in its own right, rather than a ligature or letter-diacritic combination; therefore, đá would come after dù in any alphabetical listing.

The Đ character is formed by adding a breve to the letter D. The breve is a diacritic mark that looks like a small line above the letter. In Vietnamese, the breve is used to indicate a voiced alveolar implosive sound.

Here are some examples of words that contain the Đ character:

* Đất (land)
* Đá (stone)
* Đầm (lake)
* Đống (heap)
* Đừng (don't)

The Đ character is also used in some loanwords from other languages, such as:

* Đờ (from French: d)
* Đố (from Chinese: 賭)
* Đuốc (from Chinese: 火炬)

The Đ character is a unique and important part of the Vietnamese alphabet. It is used to represent a sound that is not found in most other languages.
