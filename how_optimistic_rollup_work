An optimistic rollup is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It works by moving computation and state storage off-chain, while still maintaining security by posting transaction data to Ethereum.

Here's how it works in more detail:

1. Users send transactions to an optimistic rollup.
2. The transactions are processed off-chain by a sequencer.
3. The sequencer bundles the transactions into a batch and submits it to Ethereum.
4. A fraud verifier checks the batch to make sure it is valid.
5. If the batch is valid, it is accepted by Ethereum and the transactions are processed.
6. If the batch is invalid, the sequencer is penalized.

Optimistic rollups offer a number of advantages over other scaling solutions, including:

* High throughput: Optimistic rollups can process thousands of transactions per second.
* Low fees: Optimistic rollups can offer significantly lower fees than Ethereum.
* Security: Optimistic rollups are secured by Ethereum's consensus mechanism.

Optimistic rollups are one of the most promising scaling solutions for Ethereum. They offer a high degree of scalability and security, while still being compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem.

Here are some of the benefits of using optimistic rollups:

* **Low fees:** Optimistic rollups can offer significantly lower fees than Ethereum. This is because the computation and state storage are moved off-chain, which reduces the amount of work that needs to be done on Ethereum.
* **High throughput:** Optimistic rollups can process thousands of transactions per second. This is because the transactions are processed off-chain, which allows for parallelization.
* **Security:** Optimistic rollups are secured by Ethereum's consensus mechanism. This means that they are as secure as Ethereum itself.

If you are looking for a way to scale your Ethereum application and reduce your fees, then optimistic rollups are a great option.
