Slasher is an organic weedkiller that is made from plant oils (GM-free) which have been converted into a natural acid called nonanoic acid (also known as pelargonic acid). Nonanoic acid can be found in pelargoniums in large quantities and is also produced in other plants when stressed.

When Slasher is sprayed over plants, it destroys the outer leaf cells causing the plant to desiccate, wilt and die. Slasher is fast acting and requires minimal sunlight or heat to work. Weeds wilt within a few hours and are usually dead by the next day.

Slasher is a non-selective contact herbicide, which means that it will kill any plant that it comes into contact with. This includes both weeds and desirable plants, so it is important to be careful when using it. Slasher should not be used on edible plants or plants that you want to keep alive.

Slasher is a safe and effective way to control weeds in your garden. It is non-toxic to humans and animals, and it breaks down quickly in the environment. Slasher is a good choice for people who are looking for an organic alternative to traditional herbicides.

Here are some tips for using Slasher:

* Read the label carefully and follow the instructions.
* Wear gloves and eye protection when using Slasher.
* Apply Slasher to dry leaves in the morning or evening.
* Avoid spraying Slasher on windy days.
* Do not apply Slasher to wet plants or if rain is imminent.
* Keep pets and children away from treated areas until the spray has dried.

Slasher is a great way to control weeds in your garden without using harmful chemicals. It is safe, effective, and easy to use.
