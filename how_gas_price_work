Gasoline prices are determined by a complex set of factors, including:

* The price of crude oil: Crude oil is the main ingredient in gasoline, so the price of crude oil has a big impact on the price of gasoline.
* The cost of refining crude oil: Gasoline is made from crude oil, but it takes a lot of energy to turn crude oil into gasoline. The cost of refining crude oil also affects the price of gasoline.
* The cost of transporting gasoline: Gasoline has to be transported from the refinery to the gas station. The cost of transportation also affects the price of gasoline.
* Taxes: Gasoline is taxed by the federal government and by many state governments. These taxes add to the cost of gasoline.
* Demand: The demand for gasoline also affects the price. When demand is high, prices go up. When demand is low, prices go down.

Gas prices can also be affected by a number of other factors, such as:

* Political events: Political events, such as wars or embargoes, can disrupt the supply of oil and drive up prices.
* Weather: Weather events, such as hurricanes or snowstorms, can disrupt the supply of oil and drive up prices.
* Speculation: Speculation is when people buy and sell oil futures contracts in the hope of making a profit. Speculation can also drive up prices.

In general, gas prices tend to be higher in the summer than in the winter. This is because demand for gasoline is higher in the summer, when people are driving more.

There is no single person or organization that controls gas prices. Instead, gas prices are determined by the market forces of supply and demand.
