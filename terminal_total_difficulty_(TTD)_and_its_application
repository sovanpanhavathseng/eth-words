Terminal total difficulty is a concept used in blockchain systems, including Ethereum, to measure the overall difficulty of the blockchain network. It represents the cumulative difficulty of all blocks in the blockchain up to a specific point in time.

The application of terminal total difficulty is primarily seen in blockchain explorers and analytics platforms. It allows users to compare the relative security and stability of different blockchain networks or specific points in time within a blockchain. By analyzing the terminal total difficulty, developers, miners, and researchers can assess the level of computational work required to validate and secure the blockchain network.

Terminal total difficulty can also be used to determine the "longest chain" in a blockchain consensus algorithm like Proof of Work. In such algorithms, the chain with the highest total difficulty is considered the valid and accepted version of the blockchain.

Overall, terminal total difficulty provides a quantifiable measure of the computational effort invested in a blockchain, helping assess network security and track the progress of a blockchain's growth and consensus.
