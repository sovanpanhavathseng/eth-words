An ice age is a long period of time when Earth's climate is much colder than it is today. During an ice age, large areas of the planet are covered in ice and snow. The last ice age ended about 12,000 years ago.

Scientists are not sure what causes ice ages, but they believe that a combination of factors is involved. These factors include:

* The Earth's orbit around the sun. The Earth's orbit around the sun is not a perfect circle. Instead, it is slightly elliptical. This means that the Earth is sometimes closer to the sun than it is at other times. When the Earth is closer to the sun, it receives more sunlight. This can cause the planet to warm up.
* The Earth's tilt. The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees. This tilt causes the amount of sunlight that different parts of the Earth receive to vary throughout the year. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, it receives more sunlight and is warmer. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, it receives less sunlight and is colder.
* The amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap heat from the sun, which can cause the planet to warm up. The amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has been increasing in recent years, due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels. This is believed to be one of the main causes of global warming.

When the Earth's climate is cold enough, ice sheets and glaciers begin to form. Ice sheets are large, thick sheets of ice that cover a large area of land. Glaciers are smaller than ice sheets and move slowly over the land. As ice sheets and glaciers grow, they cover more and more of the planet. This can have a significant impact on the environment, as it can change the landscape, disrupt ecosystems, and displace people.

Ice ages typically last for millions of years. However, the climate can change within an ice age, with periods of warmer temperatures called interglacials alternating with periods of colder temperatures called glacials. We are currently living in an interglacial period, which began about 12,000 years ago.

It is not known for sure how long the current interglacial period will last. However, scientists believe that it is likely to end in the next few tens of thousands of years, when the Earth enters another ice age.
